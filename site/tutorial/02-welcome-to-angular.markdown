<h3 id="angular-is-for-web-apps">Angular is for web apps</h3>
<p>Angular is a client-side structural framework for creating dynamic web
 applications. It uses HTML as the template language and allows you to
 extend HTML to accommodate the needs of your application.</p>

<h3 id="angular-is-dynamic">Angular is dynamic</h3>
<p>Angular helps you extend HTML’s syntax to create custom elements and
 attributes that contain application behavior. Angular reduces the need
 to do DOM manipulation as directives create reusable components that do
 most of what you need without requiring you to repeat DOM boilerplate
 everywhere. This allows you to concentrate on your application’s logic,
 and not on how to trick the browser into doing what you want.</p>

<h3 id="angular-encourages-mvc">Angular encourages MVC</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">
 MVC</a> pattern from Angular’s perspective: Separate applications into
 distinct presentation, data, and logic components. Encourage loose
 coupling between these components.</p>

<h3 id="angularjs-and-angulardart">AngularJS and AngularDart</h3>
<p>Angular exists in two flavors: <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org">
 AngularJS</a>, and AngularDart. AngularJS and AngularDart are similar
 concepts, but have some big differences in implementation. This
 tutorial focuses on AngularDart. We will not compare AngularDart with
 AngularJS, or discuss how, where and why they diverge.</p>

<p>This tutorial is intended to get you started on AngularDart, and not to
 serve as a comparison between the two flavors of Angular.</p>

<h3 id="where-can-i-find-more-information">
Where can I find more information?</h3>
<p>Read the
 <a href="https://docs.angulardart.org">
   AngularDart API documentation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="lets-get-started">Let’s get started</h3>
<p>A good way to learn about AngularDart is to create a small application.
 This tutorial will take you through several iterations of a simple
 Recipe Book App. Each iteration will build on the previous one,
 explaining new Angular concepts and introducing new features.</p>
